# Async/Await and New Promise in JavaScript

In this guide, we'll explore two important concepts in JavaScript: **async functions (async/await)** and **new Promise**. These tools make asynchronous code easier to write and understand.

## What is a Promise?

A `Promise` is an object in JavaScript that represents the result of an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states:
- **Pending** — the operation is still in progress.
- **Resolved** — the operation completed successfully.
- **Rejected** — the operation failed.

### Example of using a Promise:

```javascript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let success = true;

    if (success) {
        resolve("Operation was successful!");
    } else {
        reject("An error occurred.");
    }
});

promise.then((message) => {
    console.log(message);  // Will log: Operation was successful!
}).catch((message) => {
    console.log(message);  // Will log: An error occurred.
});
