# HTTP and HTTPS

## Introduction

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) are protocols used for data transmission on the internet. In this lecture, we will explore the main differences between them and their importance.

## What is HTTP?

HTTP is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext documents, such as HTML. It operates at the application layer and uses TCP to establish a connection between the client and the server.

### Key Characteristics of HTTP:
- **Security**: HTTP does not encrypt data, making it vulnerable to attacks.
- **Port**: HTTP uses port 80.
- **Performance**: HTTP is faster because it does not require data encryption and decryption.

## What is HTTPS?

HTTPS is an extension of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data. This ensures the secure transmission of data between the client and the server.

### Key Characteristics of HTTPS:
- **Security**: HTTPS encrypts data, protecting it from interception and attacks.
- **Port**: HTTPS uses port 443.
- **Performance**: HTTPS is slightly slower due to the need for encryption and decryption, but modern technologies minimize this difference.

## Advantages of HTTPS

1. **Security**: Data encryption protects it from interception.
2. **User Trust**: Having HTTPS increases user trust in your website.
3. **SEO**: Search engines like Google prefer sites with HTTPS.

## Conclusion

Using HTTPS instead of HTTP is an important step in ensuring data security and increasing user trust in your website. Despite the slight performance overhead, the benefits of HTTPS far outweigh its drawbacks.
